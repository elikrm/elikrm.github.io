            <h1>My Projects:</h1>
            <h2>Electrical Projects:</h2>
            <p>In my free time I have designed some embedded electronics projects with microcontrollers such as 
                MSP430, ATmega16A, Arduino board, and Raspberry Pi. 
                Through these projects I implemented different concepts of ADC, Comparator, 
                UART/SPI/I2C, Timer.  
                As a part of Brisbane She Codes Plus cohort I learned and worked on projects using HTML/CSS, Python, Django and React.Some of my projects are listed below.

                <p>By using python OOP, I analysed and visualised two different kinds of json files containing weather data, One contains
                    the 5 day forecast, the other contains historical data for a 24 hour period. I convert this data into A summary of the forecast with specific output formatting. 
                    The project used unit tests to check the functions run correctly.
                    In the second part of this project, I used Plotly to produce two single time series graphs with the expected output.

                <h3>Build an Application with Django Rest Framework and React</h3>
                <p>I worked as part of a team of 4, and together we were assigned a project topic and a client.
                    Our technical solution was to create a website that allows users to set up their own parameters 
                    for separating their money between accounts.
                    We met with our client four times, for the following purposes:
                    <li>An initial meeting to discuss our project topic and to determine what features in our MVP.</li>
                    <li>Two 30 minute meetings to demonstrate what progress has been made on the MVP and to getfeedback.</li>
                    <li>Finally a presentation to demonstrate the completed MVP to the client</li>
                    This project has been separated into two distinct projects:
                    <li>an API built using the Django Rest Framework and </li>
                    <li>a website built using React.</li>
                    Both of these components have been deployed on Heroku. The React project used the deployed API.
                    <li>Have user accounts and use Token Authentication to implement appropriate authentication and
                        authorization.</li>
                    <li>Return the relevant status codes for both successful and unsuccessful requests to the API and handle failed requests gracefully (e.g. you should have a custom 404 page rather than the default error page).</li>
                    <li>Implement responsive design to multiple screen sizes and devices.</li>
                </p>

                <h3>Build a Crowdfunding app with Django Rest Framework (DRF) and React</h3>
                <p>This project is separated into two distinct projects:an API built using the Django Rest Framework -
                React was used to create the actual website for my Crowdfunding site.
                For Part A, I built the backend database and set up API end points using DRF, and tested them using Insomnia.
                <li>The GET method was set up to allow all projects to be viewed, as well as individual projects, to view all pledges and individual pledges, and to view user data.</li>
                <li>The POST method was set up to allow a new user to register themselves on the site, to create a new project, to be able to pledge to a project, and to obtain a token for authorisation.</li>
                <li>The PUT method was set up to allow a user to edit their own details, edit their project or allow pledges to be edited.</li>
                <li>The DELETE method was set up to allow a user to delete their project, pledge and their own user account.</li>
                Part B created the Front End by using React which covered
                <li>Functional pages and forms were set up to link to the API endpoints created in DRF and the site was deployed via Heroku.</li>
                <li>The site includes the ability to register as a new user, login, view projects, create projects and edit projects. The pledge option is not currently functional. There is also a custom '404 page not found’ page instead of the default error page w
                    hen a user tries to access a link that does not exist, or if they try to edit a project they are not authorised to do so.</li>
                <li>The functionality of the pages and forms was set up to match the API endpoints and database schema that was prepared using DRF in Part A.</li>
