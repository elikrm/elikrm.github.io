        <p><a href="">lub lub lub</a></p>
        <p>Perseverance or persistence in working on my goal despite facing many obstacles is the second positive side of me. I am highly inclined to believe the act of working hard towards my dreams/goals despite delayed success.
            I have the ability to communicate effectively with my superiors, and my colleagues, since I always try to be an active listener which involves paying close attention to what the other person is saying, asking clarifying questions, and rephrasing what the person says to ensure understanding. 
            Though I am confident in my interactions with others, Of course, I am careful not to sound arrogant or aggressive. I am always listening to and empathizing with the other person.
            I encourage my co-workers to engage in open and honest communication with me through a friendly tone, a personal question, or simply a smile, I believe it's important to be polite in my workplace communications.
